        Which month (e.g., 3) in 2021 witnessed the highest percent of Bitcoin volume that took place in CoinJoin transactions? Also give me the percentage of CoinJoins transactions, the average input and output UTXOs ratio, and the proportion of CoinJoin transaction volume for that month (all 1 decimal).

        To solve this problem, I need to identify CoinJoin transactions in Bitcoin during 2021 and calculate relevant statistics by month. Here's my approach step by step:

        1. First, I need to identify what makes a transaction a CoinJoin. CoinJoin transactions typically have multiple inputs from different users and multiple outputs of the same value. A common heuristic is to look for transactions with multiple inputs and at least 5 outputs, where many outputs have the same value.

        2. I'll create a CTE called 'bitcoin_transactions' that:
          - Extracts month from the block timestamp (converting from microseconds to standard timestamp)
          - Flags transactions as CoinJoin if they have at least 2 inputs, 5 outputs, and if more than half of the outputs have the same value
          - Filters for only 2021 transactions

        3. Next, I'll create a 'monthly_stats' CTE that aggregates by month:
          - Count of total transactions
          - Count of CoinJoin transactions
          - Total transaction volume
          - Volume of CoinJoin transactions
          - Average input/output ratio for CoinJoin transactions

        4. Finally, I'll select the month with the highest percentage of CoinJoin volume:
          - Extract just the month number
          - Calculate percentage of CoinJoin transactions (rounded to 1 decimal)
          - Calculate average input/output ratio (rounded to 1 decimal)
          - Calculate percentage of volume in CoinJoin transactions (rounded to 1 decimal)
          - Sort by CoinJoin volume percentage in descending order
          - Limit to the top result

        The query identifies CoinJoin transactions using a heuristic based on common patterns in these privacy-enhancing transactions and provides all the requested statistics for the month with the highest CoinJoin volume percentage in 2021.

        The error is related to the identifier 'v."value"' in the subquery that's trying to flatten the outputs. The nested LATERAL FLATTEN was causing the issue. I've simplified the approach by directly using the flattened outputs table and accessing its value column. The corrected query removes the unnecessary LATERAL FLATTEN and references the value from the flattened outputs directly as 'o.value' instead of the previous nested approach.
