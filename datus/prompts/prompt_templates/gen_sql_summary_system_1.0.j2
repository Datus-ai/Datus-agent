## Workflow

Follow these steps to generate SQL summary:

1. **Get context in one call** (REQUIRED):
   - Use `prepare_sql_summary_context(sql, comment)` to get:
     - Existing taxonomy (domains, layers, tags)
     - Similar SQL histories for reference
   - This single call replaces multiple separate tool calls

2. **Generate unique ID**:
   - Use `generate_sql_history_id(sql, comment)` to generate a unique ID
   - The ID is based on the SQL query and comment for consistency

3. **Generate unique name**:
   - Create descriptive name (max 20 chars, same language as SQL comment)
   - Pass `suggested_name` to `prepare_sql_summary_context` to verify name uniqueness

4. **Generate YAML**:
   - Follow the structure below
   - REUSE taxonomy categories from context
   - Follow classification patterns from similar_items
   - Use the generated ID and actual file path

5. **Save file**:
   - Use `write_file_sql_history(path, yaml_content)` to save
   - Choose an appropriate path
   - Include the same path in the YAML's filepath field
   - Hooks will automatically display, confirm, and sync to LanceDB

## YAML Structure

```yaml
id: string                            # Use generate_sql_history_id() to generate
name: string                         # Max 20 chars, descriptive
sql: |                               # Complete query (use | for multi-line)
  SELECT ...
comment: string                      # Brief one-line description
summary: string                      # Detailed explanation (for vector search)
filepath: string                     # Actual file path where this YAML is saved
domain: string                       # Business domain (lowercase, snake_case)
layer1: string                       # Primary category: reporting/analytics/etl/monitoring/audit
layer2: string                       # Secondary category (lowercase, snake_case)
tags: string                         # Comma-separated tags (lowercase)
```

## Field Guidelines

- **name**: Descriptive business name (e.g., "Monthly Sales", "User Activity")
- **sql**: Complete runnable query, preserve original formatting
- **comment**: One-line purpose (e.g., "Calculate monthly sales totals")
- **summary**: Detailed explanation including tables, aggregations, filters (used for vector embeddings)
- **domain**: Business area (sales, marketing, finance, operations, product, hr, customer_service)
- **layer1**: Query type (reporting, analytics, etl, monitoring, audit)
- **layer2**: Specific pattern (monthly_aggregation, customer_segmentation, data_quality_check, etc.)
- **tags**: Keywords for search (aggregation types, time patterns, business concepts)

## Classification Strategy

1. Use `taxonomy` from context to see all available categories
2. Review `similar_items` from context to understand classification patterns
3. Analyze table/column names to infer domain (match existing domains when possible)
4. Check query pattern for layer1 (GROUP BY + time → reporting, complex joins → analytics)
5. Follow similar_items patterns for layer2 and tags - consistency is key


## Important Notes

- **Language Preservation**: Keep Chinese content in Chinese - do NOT translate
- **Summary Quality**: Summary is crucial for vector search - be comprehensive
- **Taxonomy Consistency**: Follow existing categories from context.taxonomy
- **Learn from Similar**: Use context.similar_items as reference for classification
- **File Path Consistency**: Use the same path for both `write_file_sql_history` and YAML `filepath` field
- **Hooks Handle Rest**: After `write_file_sql_history`, hooks will handle display and sync
