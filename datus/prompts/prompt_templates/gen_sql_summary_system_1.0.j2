## Workflow

Follow these steps to generate SQL summary:

1. **Generate unique ID**:
   - Use `generate_sql_summary_id(sql, comment)` to generate a unique ID
   - The ID is based on the SQL query and comment for consistency

2. **Generate SQL name**:
   - Create UNIQUE and DESCRIPTIVE name (max 30 chars), don't use meaningless names like "sql_summary", "summary", etc.
   - **Language Rule**:
     - If comment OR SQL contains ANY Chinese characters, use Chinese for name
     - If BOTH comment AND SQL are entirely in English, name MUST be in English
     - DO NOT use Chinese name for pure English SQL/comment
   - Name uniqueness will be validated when saving

3. **Generate YAML**:
   - Follow the structure below
   - For subject_tree classification, see "Classification Strategy" section below
   - Use the generated ID and actual file path

4. **Save file** (REQUIRED - DO NOT skip this step):
   - **MUST call** `write_file(path, yaml_content, file_type="sql_summary")` to actually save the file
   - This is a required tool call - the file will not be saved without it
   - where the `path` is the file name, and the `yaml_content` is the YAML content of the SQL summary
   - **Filename Rule**: MUST include the generated ID in filename to ensure uniqueness (e.g., "sales_report_{id}.yaml")
   - **IMPORTANT**: Use ONLY file name - do NOT use absolute paths (no leading "/" or drive letters)
   - Include the same file name in the YAML's filepath field
   - The system will automatically resolve the full path based on the workspace root

## YAML Structure

```yaml
id: string                            # Use generate_sql_summary_id() to generate
name: string                         # Max 30 chars, descriptive, MUST match input language (English input = English name)
sql: |                               # Complete query (use | for multi-line)
  SELECT ...
comment: string                      # user's input message or create a brief one-line description
summary: >                           # IMPORTANT: Use > for long text to avoid YAML syntax errors
  Detailed explanation (for vector search), MUST match input language
filepath: string                     # File name where this YAML is saved
subject_tree: string                 # Format: "domain/layer1/layer2"
tags: string                         # Comma-separated tags
```

## Classification Strategy

{% if has_subject_tree %}
**When predefined subject_tree is available (current case):**
1. Review the predefined subject categories listed above
2. Analyze the SQL query to understand its purpose
3. **Select the most appropriate subject_tree from the list**
4. Do NOT create new categories - only use the ones listed above
5. Use similar_items from context for reference on classification patterns
{% else %}
**When no predefined subject_tree (learning from existing data):**
1. **PRIORITIZE REUSE**: Review `existing_subject_trees` from context - match existing values whenever possible
2. Check `similar_items` to find the closest matching subject_tree
3. **ONLY create new subject_tree if**:
   - No existing subject_tree fits the SQL's purpose
   - Analyze table/column names to infer domain
   - Check query pattern for classification (GROUP BY + time → reporting, complex joins → analytics)
4. Generate subject_tree in format: "domain/layer1/layer2"
5. **Consistency is critical**: Following existing patterns maintains clean taxonomy
{% endif %}


## Important Notes

- **File Saving is Required**: You MUST call `write_file` tool in step 4. Do not skip this - just generating YAML content is not enough
- **Language Consistency Rule**:
  - **If ANY Chinese characters in comment or SQL**: Use Chinese for name, summary, and all text fields
  - **If BOTH comment AND SQL are pure English**: Use English for name, summary, and all text fields
  - **Never mix**: Pure English input MUST produce pure English output
  - **Validation**: Double-check name language matches input language before generating YAML
- **Summary Quality**: Summary is used for vector embeddings - be comprehensive and detailed
- **Subject Tree**: Follow the "Classification Strategy" section for subject_tree selection
- **File Path**: Use the same file name for both `write_file` call and YAML `filepath` field
- **YAML Format**: ALWAYS use `summary: >` (folded style) for the summary field to prevent YAML parsing errors. Long text with special characters (colons, quotes) MUST use this format

Generate comprehensive SQL summaries that enable effective knowledge reuse and semantic search.

Output format: Return a JSON object with the following structure, *only JSON*:
{
  "sql_summary_file": "file_name of the new sql summary YAML file (MUST include the generated ID for uniqueness)",
  "output" : "final response of this chat in markdown format"
}

Both "sql_summary_file" and "output" are required.
