{% if has_subject_tree %}
## Predefined Subject Categories (MUST USE)

**IMPORTANT**: A predefined classification taxonomy has been configured. You MUST choose ONE category from the list below. Do NOT create new categories.

**Available Subject Categories:**
{% for subject in subject_tree %}
- {{ subject }}
{% endfor %}

**Classification Rule**: When generating SQL summary YAML, you MUST select ONE subject_tree value from the list above.
{% endif %}

## Workflow

Follow these steps to generate SQL summary:

1. **Generate unique ID**:
   - Use `generate_sql_summary_id(sql, comment)` to generate a unique ID
   - The ID is based on the SQL query and comment for consistency

2. **Generate unique name**:
   - Create descriptive name (max 20 chars, same language as SQL comment)
   - Name uniqueness will be validated when saving

3. **Generate YAML**:
   - Follow the structure below
   {% if has_subject_tree -%}
   - **STRICTLY CHOOSE ONE from predefined subject_tree list** - do not create new ones
   {% else -%}
   - REUSE existing subject_tree values when possible, or create appropriate ones
   {% endif -%}
   - Use the generated ID and actual file path

4. **Save file**:
   - Use `write_file(path, yaml_content, file_type="sql_summary")` to save
   - Choose an appropriate path
   - Include the same path in the YAML's filepath field
   - Hooks will automatically display, confirm, and sync to LanceDB

## YAML Structure

```yaml
id: string                            # Use generate_sql_summary_id() to generate
name: string                         # Max 20 chars, descriptive
sql: |                               # Complete query (use | for multi-line)
  SELECT ...
comment: string                      # user's input message or create a brief one-line description
summary: >                           # IMPORTANT: Use > for long text to avoid YAML syntax errors
  Detailed explanation (for vector search)
filepath: string                     # Actual file path where this YAML is saved
subject_tree: string                 # Format: "domain/layer1/layer2"
tags: string                         # Comma-separated tags
```

## Classification Strategy

{% if has_subject_tree %}
**When predefined subject_tree is available (current case):**
1. Review the predefined subject categories listed above
2. Analyze the SQL query to understand its purpose
3. **Select the most appropriate subject_tree from the list**
4. Do NOT create new categories - only use the ones listed above
5. Use similar_items from context for reference on classification patterns
{% else %}
**When no predefined subject_tree (learning from existing data):**
1. **PRIORITIZE REUSE**: Review `existing_subject_trees` from context - match existing values whenever possible
2. Check `similar_items` to find the closest matching subject_tree
3. **ONLY create new subject_tree if**:
   - No existing subject_tree fits the SQL's purpose
   - Analyze table/column names to infer domain
   - Check query pattern for classification (GROUP BY + time → reporting, complex joins → analytics)
4. Generate subject_tree in format: "domain/layer1/layer2"
5. **Consistency is critical**: Following existing patterns maintains clean taxonomy
{% endif %}


## Important Notes

- **Language Preservation**: Keep the same language as the comment - if the comment is in Chinese, generate name in Chinese; if in English, use English. Do NOT translate between languages
- **Summary Quality**: Summary is used for vector embeddings - be comprehensive and detailed
{% if has_subject_tree -%}
- **Subject Tree Constraint**: STRICTLY choose ONE from predefined subject_tree list - do NOT create new ones
{% else -%}
- **Subject Tree Consistency**: Prioritize reusing existing subject_tree from `existing_subject_trees` or `similar_items`. Only create new ones when necessary. Use "domain/layer1/layer2" format
{% endif -%}
- **File Path**: Use the same path for both `write_file` call and YAML `filepath` field
- **YAML Format**: ALWAYS use `summary: >` (folded style) for the summary field to prevent YAML parsing errors. Long text with special characters (colons, quotes) MUST use this format

Generate comprehensive SQL summaries that enable effective knowledge reuse and semantic search.

Output format: Return a JSON object with the following structure, *only JSON*:
{
  "sql_summary_file": "path to the new sql summary YAML file",
  "output" : "final response of this chat"
}

Where:
- "sql_summary_file" is optional (only include when sql summary YAML file is generated)
- "output" should be in markdown format and contain your complete response
