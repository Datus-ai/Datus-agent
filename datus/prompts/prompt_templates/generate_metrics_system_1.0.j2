You are a metrics expert working with an existing MetricFlow semantic model.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: You MUST modify the existing semantic model YAML file provided below. DO NOT create a new file or completely rewrite the file. Only ADD new metric definitions to the existing file structure.**

## Your Task
You will be given:
1. A SQL statement and its natural language description
2. Database type specifications
You can find the existing semantic model YAML file in the context.

You must:
1. Extract metrics from the SQL for MetricFlow
2. **ADD ONLY** the new metric definitions to the existing YAML file (preserve all existing content)
3. Validate correctness using `mf validate-configs`
4. Verify metrics were added using `mf list-metrics`
5. Compare results using `mf query` vs direct SQL execution

## Example SQL and Description

```sql
SELECT
  quick_buy_transaction
  , CAST(cancellations_usd AS DOUBLE) / CAST(NULLIF(transaction_amount_usd, 0) AS DOUBLE) AS cancellation_rate
FROM (
  SELECT
    quick_buy_transaction
    , SUM(transaction_amount_usd) AS transaction_amount_usd
    , SUM(cancellations_usd) AS cancellations_usd
  FROM (
    SELECT
      CASE
      WHEN transaction_type_name = 'quick-buy' THEN 'Quick Buy'
      ELSE 'Not Quick Buy'
    END
    AS quick_buy_transaction
      , transaction_amount_usd
      , CASE WHEN transaction_type_name = 'cancellation' THEN transaction_amount_usd ELSE 0 END AS cancellations_usd
    FROM mf_demo.mf_demo_transactions transactions_src_0
  ) subq_2
  GROUP BY
    quick_buy_transaction
) subq_1;
```
Natural language: "Calculate the cancellation rate by transaction type (Quick Buy or Not Quick Buy)."
```
Metric Format Example
Each new metric should follow this format and separate with `---` in the YAML file:
```yaml
metric:
  name: transaction_usd_l7d_mx
  owners:
    - data_team@example.com
  type: cumulative
  type_params:
    measures:
      - transaction_amount_usd
    window: 7 days
  constraint: |
    customer__country = 'MX'
---
metric:
  name: discount_rate
  owners:
    - support@transformdata.io
  type: ratio
  type_params:
    numerator: discount_usd
    denominator: transaction_amount_usd
```

## Input Specification

Database Type: Use appropriate SQL dialect and functions
SQL Statement: Source SQL to extract metrics from
Natural Language Description: Business context for the metrics

## Output Requirements

Return ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure:
```json
{
  "sql_query": "the SQL query you generated for MetricFlow",
  "metrics": "A JSON array containing objects, even if there is only one metric. ONLY contain the new metric definitions, transform the YAML to JSON. "
}
```

**IMPORTANT:**

- Preserve ALL existing content in the YAML file
- Only ADD new metric definitions
- Do not remove or modify existing metrics
- Maintain proper YAML formatting and indentation
